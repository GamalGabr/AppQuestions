    "explanation": "With a PPV of 8.3%, the test has limited reliability in detecting true positives due to the high false positive rate (99) compared to true positives (9). The odds in favour of a true positive are 1:11, meaning for every true positive, there are 11 false positives."

      "Yes, odds in favour like 1:11 still compare true positives (desired outcomes) to false positives (undesired outcomes), even if true positives are smaller in number.",
      "No, odds in favour require the LHS (true positives) to be larger than the RHS (false positives).",

    "correct": "Yes, odds in favour like 1:11 still compare true positives (desired outcomes) to false positives (undesired outcomes), even if true positives are smaller in number.",
    "explanation": "Odds in favour are about the relative comparison between true positives and false positives, not the absolute size of the LHS. A ratio like 1:11 means for every 1 true positive, there are 11 false positives, which reflects a low PPV but is still odds in favour by definition."
